# Peer-to-Peer Chat App (Gun.js)

A modern, real-time, peer-to-peer chat application built with [Gun.js](https://gun.eco/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This project aims to become a full-featured, decentralized chat platform with public and private messaging, user presence, and a beautiful, responsive UI.

## Features

- **Decentralized Messaging:** Uses Gun.js for peer-to-peer, real-time data sync.
- **Public Chat Room:** All users can chat together in a global room.
- **Private Messaging:** Start private conversations with any online user.
- **User Presence:** See who is online in real time.
- **Unique Aliases:** Choose or generate a unique name to join the chat.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive, dark-themed interface powered by Tailwind CSS.
- **No Backend Required:** Runs entirely in the browser using distributed Gun.js peers.
